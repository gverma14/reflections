When you initialize a repo, it sets up a base to track files. You need to do it
to have something to commit.

Staging area is a way to show what files have changed vs. what files will remain the same
in the newest commit. Working directory is just the files that exist on the system as is.

Branches would be helpful when trying to make a new change, but don't necessarily want to break 
existing functionality of the program.

Diagrams help visualize how git goes through different branches and changes when you move.

Merging finds what's in common and compiles it and finds what's added and adds it.

Pros of automatic merging are that it's faster. Cons are that you don't get to see what you're doing
and it's not always reliable. Pros of manual merging are that you have more control but it takes longer
