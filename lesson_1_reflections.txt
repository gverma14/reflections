The diff command made it easier to see
what code was added and removed, that way
I could follow the logic much easier and fix the error.

Having easy access to the history makes it so
that I can see the earlier mistakes I made.

Pros of manually choosing when to commit is there will
be a more logical sense on where the save points are.
Cons of this system are that you have to remember yourself 
and it's possible that you could forget.

Git allows for saving multiple files so it treats it as one entire project
where all the files relate to each other.

git log and git diff allow you to go through the history of commits so you can 
see exactly what changes were made

Using version control makes it easier to spot mistakes that might have been made

Would like to use it for different versions of apps
