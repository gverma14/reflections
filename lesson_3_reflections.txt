Using a remote repository is good for sharing your work with others.

You would want to pull changes manually because you might be in the middle of making
a feature change that may not be able to merge properly with a change someone else has made
right away.

Forks allow you to take a project on Github and clone them on Github itself giving credit to the author. 
Clones take a project on Github and allow you to modify them locally.
Branches allow you to deviate from what you're currently working on to work on experimental features that
won't break what is already working.

Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally allows you to merge changes on the go.
